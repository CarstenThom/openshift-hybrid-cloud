#T o configure a release of OLM for installation in a cluster:

# Create a my-values.yaml like the example above with the desired configuration or choose an existing one from this repository. The latest production values can be found in deploy/tectonic-alm-operator/values.yaml.
# Generate deployment files from the templates and the my-values.yaml using package-release.sh
# first arg must be a semver-compatible version string
# second arg is the output directory
# third arg is the values.yaml file
# ./scripts/package-release.sh 1.0.0-myolm ./my-olm-deployment my-values.yaml
# Deploy to kubernetes: kubectl apply -f ./my-olm-deployment/templates/
# The above steps are automated for official releases with make ver=0.3.0 release, which will output new versions of manifests in deploy/tectonic-alm-operator/manifests/$(ver).
